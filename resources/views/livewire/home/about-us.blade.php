                The Pottery Studio began in Atwater Village, when our owner, Marshall Blair - who had been making plates and bowls for his restaurants since 2015 - purchased a gas kiln and invited a few other potters to help fill it. More and more potters came, so we started adding classes, and The Pottery Studio officially began.

                In 2018 we moved the studio from Atwater to our current spacious building in the Cypress Park neighborhood. The Pottery Studio has continued to become home for hundreds of potters, students and a vibrant ceramic community. Since moving to 2808 Elm St. the studio has grown and expanded to new locations.

                In February 2021, we opened our second location at 14943 Califa Street in Sherman Oaks, CA. As each studio continues to grow, the spirit and interest in aspects of ceramic work takes shape at each location.

                This studio is home to our first kilns by Paul Geil, who has constructed kilns for ceramic institutions nationally and internationally, and has provided incredible resources and vision to the firing process.

                In August 2021, we then opened the Culver City location at 8455 Steller Drive. Originally a medical supply warehouse, we knew the location would be open, airy, and the ideal setting for a studio. After months of work to restore the building to its original splendor, we opened to fresh breezes and the beautiful natural light of the westside of Los Angeles.

                The Chicago studio opened in May 2022 in the Bucktown neighborhood. Many folks ask - why we opened a studio in Chicago. It's a place Marshall spent many years and came up as a chef, and a city we love for it's incredible history, buildings, and creative spirit.

                Anyone who's spent any time in Chicago catches the genuine spirit and friendliness of the place. We're excited to bring new clays and Cone 10 firing to this studio, and engage with the ceramic community to provide a membership offering as well as classes to cultivate and support working potters.

                Our San Francisco location on the corner of 20th and Folsom in the Mission District was a longtime dream come to life. From the first visits to the building, we knew it would be home to hundreds of potters, as members and students, one day. We opened in November 2022, an continue to grow and evolve. We are delighted to be offering cone 10 reduction firings in the city.
